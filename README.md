# README

In preparation for the 7.0 community release, the "droolsjbpm" organization on GitHub was renamed to "kiegroup" on Monday, March 13th.

While the rename has no effect on the code itself, if you have cloned the code repository, you will need to update your local copy with the proper remote URL changing it from:

https://github.com/droolsjbpm (https)
git@github.com:droolsjbpm (ssh)

   To:

https://github.com/kiegroup (https)
git@github.com:kiegroup (ssh)
